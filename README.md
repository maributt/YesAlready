## YesAlready

This plugin stores a list of Yes/No dialogs (among others) and clicks yes for you when they show up. Look, I already said yes once, don't ask me again. Like for all those little prompts in dungeons. Yes I really do want to teleport to the next area in Praetorium.

Each type of dialog needs to be manually added, if you would like one that is not currently supported, please let me know.

## In-game usage
* Type `/pyes` to pull up the GUI.
* Type `/pyes help` to view additional command line arguments.

## Installation
* Clone repo and build yourself, add a path to the built `.dll` file under the Experimental tab in `/xlsettings`!
